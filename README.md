# Tip_Calculator_with_Python
This is a simple tip calculator program with Python. It calculates how much each person should pay for a bill restaurant based on the following:
- Total bill
- Number of people to split
- Tip percentage

This program demonstrates, in addition to a simple arithmetic calculation, the use of input() and value type-casting functions in Python. Furthermore, it validates a user input with a while loop. The tip percentage can only be chosen from 10, 12, 15. With the while loop, the user will have to keep entering the number until the number falls into the mentioned list before the next step of the program can be commenced.
